# Air_Cargo_Analysis-SQL
This project showcases an end-to-end SQL-based analysis for Air Cargo, an aviation company aiming to enhance customer experience and operational efficiency through data-driven decisions. The case study involved working with multiple relational datasets including customer profiles, flight records, ticket sales, and route details to derive meaningful business insights.

The project involved writing optimized SQL queries to perform various analytical tasks such as identifying frequent flyers for personalized marketing, analyzing the most traveled routes for better aircraft allocation, and generating detailed revenue and ticketing reports. Key techniques included the use of JOIN, GROUP BY, subqueries, window functions, ROLLUP, and stored procedures. Performance tuning was also incorporated using indexing and execution plans to improve query efficiency on large datasets. Views were created for filtered insights, and conditional logic (IF clause) was applied to flag revenue thresholds. Finally, aggregate metrics such as average travel distance and passenger volume per aircraft were calculated for demand forecasting. This project reflects strong command over SQL and a clear understanding of applying data analytics in the aviation domain.
